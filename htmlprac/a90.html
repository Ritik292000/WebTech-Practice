			When such a new visit method is added, the default implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method. A new abstract element visitor class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the visit method in question. When the new visitor is introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
